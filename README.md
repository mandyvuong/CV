## Skills

| Type                    | Technology                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Frameworks/Libraries    | React, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra                  |
| Databases               | PostgreSQL, Firebase                           |
| Tools                   | Git, Unix commands                             |
| Hosting                 | Heroku, Github, Firebase                       |
| Test Driven Development | Capybara, RSpec, Jasmine, Self-built framework |

**Quick independent learner:** Self-taught React and Firebase within two weeks for the Makers Academy final project, confidently implementing two APIs, Firebase database and storage. At the Royal Society the research grants management system migrated onto Flexi-grant and I confidently taught myself how to use the system, which led to taking on the role of a Flexi-expert.

**Communication:** Regular communications with applicants, award holders and other relevant stakeholders at the Royal Society. Communicated complex ideas effectively to a range of audiences at seven international conferences during my PhD.

**Team player:** Worked in a team of 3-6 on four Makers Academy group projects. At the Royal Society I’m part of a team of 35 members of staff ensuring the grants commissioning process is met to a high standard.

**Organisation/ time management:** Successfully completed the Makers Academy course using agile processes, whilst volunteering to be a mentor to two mentees and have family commitments of two under four year olds at the tail end of my maternity leave. I completed my PhD thesis whilst working full-time at the Royal Society.

## Code Reviews

Makers partners with reviewer, [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/). The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. I was observed for upto an hour on how to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

**Can model**
> "The algorithm made logical sense and you were able to meet the requirements for this program quite well."

**Can TDD**

> "You have once again based your tests on behaviours in order to keep your code properly decoupled from the tests and this also meant that the tests were client-oriented with the acceptance criteria properly encoded in the algorithm."

**Can write code that is easy to change**

> "You had your test suite properly decoupled from your implementation by making sure the tests were based solely on acceptance criteria, and not reliant on the current implementation. This makes changes to the code much easier as they will not break your test suite."

> "You have used sensible method and variable names that were derived from the client’s domain. This helped to make your code easy to understand which helps to make it easier to change as a result."

**Can debug**

> "You have quite a good debugging process and are reading the error messages clearly in order to get insight into how the code is behaving."

**Justify the way I work**

> "You have a very clear way of communicating what you are doing and why you are doing it. When debugging, you kept me updated as to what you believed the problem was and what the solution would be before making changes."

> "This type of communication will definitely show an interviewer that you make well-considered decisions while developing code."
